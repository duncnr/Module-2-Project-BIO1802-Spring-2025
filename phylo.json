They share key traits with land plants, such as chlorophyll a and b for photosynthesis, starch as an energy reserve, and cellulose-based cell walls. Most have simple lifecycles dominated by the haploid phase, with some species exhibiting alternation of generations. Unlike land plants, they lack true roots, stems, and leaves, relying on direct water absorption for survival. Some green algae, like Chara and Coleochaete, have specialized reproductive structures, suggesting an evolutionary bridge to land plants.",
            "hdes": "The green plant lineage includes both green algae and land plants, united by their use of chlorophyll a and b for photosynthesis, cellulose in their cell walls, and starch as a storage molecule. However, while green algae remained in aquatic environments, streptophyte algae evolved traits that preadapted them for land life, such as plasmodesmata for cell communication and sporopollenin-coated spores for desiccation resistance. These innovations laid the groundwork for the colonization of land.",
